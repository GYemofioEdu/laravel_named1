                <p>Best experience of my life. How I wish I could do it all over again. </p>
                <p>Wabash has plenty of both history and traditions. One of only three
                    remaining traditional, all-male liberal arts colleges in the country.
                    Roughly nine hundred students from 32 states and 12 countries.
                    Twenty-five majors. More athletic titles and honors than we can count.

                <h2>New York University</h2>
                <p>In 1831, Albert Gallatin, the distinguished statesman who served as secretary of the treasury under
                    Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, declared his intention to establish "in this immense
                    and fast-growing city ... a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously
                    opened to all." Founded in 1831, New York University is one of only 60 member institutions of the
                    distinguished Association of American Universities.
